All Kindred participating in the ritual must know the Ritual of Pochtli as well as the ritual or path power the group seeks to enact.<br><br>The downside of this power is that a single player&rsquo;s botch negates the successes of the entire group, resulting in a horrific failure for all the ritual workers.</p>",

Rituals are less versatile than paths, as their effects are singular and straightforward, but they are better suited to specific ends.<br><br>All thaumaturges have the ability to use rituals, though each individual ritual must be learned separately. By acquainting herself with the arcane practice of blood magic, the caster gains the capacity to manipulate these focused effects.<br><br>Thaumaturgical rituals are rated from 1 to 5, each level corresponding to both the level of mastery of Thaumaturgy the would-be caster must possess and the relative power of the ritual itself. Unless stated otherwise, a ritual requires five minutes per level to cast.<br><br>Casting rituals requires a successful Intelligence + Occult roll, for which the difficulty equals 3 + the level of the ritual (maximum 9). Only one success is required for a ritual to work, though certain spells may require more successes or have variable effects based on how well the caster&rsquo;s roll goes. Should a roll to activate a ritual fail, the Storyteller is encouraged to create strange occurrences or side effects, or even make it appear that the ritual was successful, only to reveal its failure at a later time. A botched ritual roll may even indicate a catastrophic failure or summon an ill-tempered demon.<br><br>Rituals sometimes require special ingredients or reagents to work &mdash; these are noted in each ritual&rsquo;s description. Common components include herbs, animal bones, ceremonial items, feathers, eye of newt, tongue of toad, etc. Acquiring magical components for a powerful ritual may form the basis for an entire story.<br><br>At the first level of Thaumaturgy, the vampire automatically gains a single Level One ritual. To learn further rituals, the thaumaturge must find someone to teach him, or learn the ritual from a scroll, tome, or other archive. Learning a new ritual can take anywhere from a few nights (Level One ritual) to months or years (Level Five ritual). Some mystics have studied individual rituals for decades, or even centuries.</p>",

The recipient of the vampire&rsquo;s Beast is instantly overcome by frenzy. This is an unnatural frenzy, however, as the victim is channeling the Kindred&rsquo;s own fury. As such, the vampire&rsquo;s own behavior, expressions, and even speech patterns are evident in the subject&rsquo;s savage actions.<br><br>Gangrel and Tzimisce are especially fond of unleashing their Beasts onto others. Gangrel do so to stir their ghouls into inspired heights of savagery during combat. Tzimisce care less about who receives their Beast than retaining their own composure.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The player must announce his preferred target (since it must be someone within sight, Drawing Out the Beast cannot be used if the vampire is alone), then roll Manipulation + Self-Control/Instinct (difficulty 8). Refer to the table below for the results:<br><br></p>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Successes</td>\n<td>Result</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 Success</td>\n<td>The character transfers the Beast, but unleashes it upon a random individual.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 Successes</td>\n<td>The character is stunned by the effort and may not act next turn, but transfers the Beast successfully. Alternatively, the character may act normally during the turn, but must spend a Willpower point or suffer a single level of lethal damage.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3+ Successes</td>\n<td>The character transfers the Beast successfully.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br>If the attempt fails, the character himself immediately enters frenzy. As the character relaxes in expectation of relieving his savage urges, the Beast takes that opportunity to dig deeper. In this case, the frenzy lasts twice as long as normal and is twice as difficult to shrug off; its severity also increases exponentially. Botching this roll is even more catastrophic; the heightened frenzy grows so extreme that not even expending Willpower curbs its duration or effects. The character is a hapless victim to the terrible fury of his Beast, and may well hurl herself into a savage, flesh-rending rampage that leaves the Masquerade (and unfortunate nearby onlookers) in tatters.<br><br>If the character leaves the target&rsquo;s presence before the frenzy expends itself, the vampire loses his Beast, perhaps permanently. While no longer vulnerable to frenzy, the character cannot use or regain Willpower and becomes increasingly lethargic. To recover the Beast, he must find the person who now possesses it (who likely isn&rsquo;t enjoying herself very much) and coax the Beast into its proper vessel. The most effective way to do so is to behave in ways that make the Beast want to return &mdash; however, this isn&rsquo;t a guarantee that it will wish to do so. Alternatively, the character can simply kill the host (thus causing the Beast to return to the vampire immediately).</p>",

This power is greatly feared by other Kindred, and all manner of hideous tales concerning methods of delivery circulate among trembling coteries. Kindred with Quietus are known to deliver the poison by coating their weapons with it, blighting their opponents with a touch, or spitting it like a cobra. An apocryphal account speaks of a proud Prince who discovered an Assamite plotting her exsanguination and began to diablerize her would-be assassin. Halfway through the act, she learned that she had ingested a dire quantity of tainted blood and was then unable to resist the weakened hashashiyyin&rsquo;s renewed attack.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The vizier version of Scorpion&rsquo;s Touch is Ishtar&rsquo;s Touch. Instead of yielding a deadly poison, this power converts the vizier&rsquo;s blood into a touch-activated narcotic that puts the victim into an inebriated state under which he is more vulnerable to Presence, Dominate, and even mundane Social manipulation.<br><br>The vizier&rsquo;s player must spend a variable number of blood points (up to their Generation maximum) and roll Willpower, (difficulty 6). If the roll succeeds and the vizier touches the target&rsquo;s exposed skin, the tainted blood passes into the target&rsquo;s blood stream through the skin. The target must then roll Stamina + Fortitude (difficulty 6) &mdash; each success subtracts from the successes rolled for the vizier. If any successes remain, the power takes effect.<br><br>While the effect lasts, the target is unable to spend Willpower to resist mental or social manipulation by the vizier, and the difficulties for all rolls by the vizier for such manipulation (whether natural or supernatural) are reduced by the number of blood points spent, to a minimum of 4. This effect only lasts while the target remains in the vizier&rsquo;s presence, after which she will come to her senses. However, if the vizier returns to the victim&rsquo;s presence, she will automatically fall back into her addled state.<br><br>This debility lasts for a duration determined by the vizier&rsquo;s successes as follows.<br><br></p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 102px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 48.9474%;\"><col style=\"width: 50.8772%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\"><strong>Successes</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\"><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">One turn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">One hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">One day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">One month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">One year</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br><br><em><strong>Original - Warrior's Version:</strong></em><br>To convert a bit of her blood to poison, the Kindred&rsquo;s player spends at least one blood point and rolls Willpower (difficulty 6). If this roll is successful, and the vampire successfully hits (but not necessarily damages) her opponent, the target loses a number of Stamina points equal to the number of blood points converted into poison &mdash; vampires attempting to drink the blood of the Kindred with Scorpion&rsquo;s Touch are automatically considered to be &ldquo;successfully hit.&rdquo;<br><br>The victim may resist the poison with a Stamina + Fortitude roll (difficulty 6); successes achieved on the resistance roll subtract from the vampire&rsquo;s successes. The maximum number of blood points a Kindred may convert at any one time is equal to her Stamina. The number of successes scored indicates the duration of the Stamina loss.<br><br></p>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong> Successes</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 Successes</td>\n<td>One Turn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 Successes</td>\n<td>One Hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 Successes</td>\n<td>One Day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 Successes</td>\n<td>One Month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 Successes</td>\n<td>Permanently (though Stamina may be bought back up with experience)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br>If a mortal&rsquo;s Stamina falls to zero through use of Scorpion&rsquo;s Touch, she becomes terminally ill and loses any immunity to diseases, her body succumbing to sickness within the year unless she somehow manages to increase her Stamina again. If a Kindred&rsquo;s Stamina falls to zero, the vampire enters torpor and remains that way until one of her Stamina points returns. If a Kindred is permanently reduced to zero Stamina, she may recover from torpor only through mystical means.<br><br></p>\n<p>To afflict someone with the poison, the Cainite must touch her target&rsquo;s flesh or hit him with something that carries the venom. Many Assamites lubricate their weapons with the excretion, while others pool the toxin in their hands (or fleck their lips with the poison, for a &ldquo;kiss of death&rdquo;) and press it to their opponents. Weapons so envenomed must be of the melee variety &mdash; arrows, sling stones, bullets, thrown weapons, and the like cannot carry enough of the stuff to do damage, or it drips off in flight. Players whose vampires wish to spit at their targets must make a Stamina + Athletics roll (difficulty 6). No more than two blood points&rsquo; worth of poison may be expectorated, and a Kindred may spit a distance of 10 feet (3 meters) for each point of Strength (and Potence) the character possesses. Vampires with Quietus are immune to their own poison, but not the blood-venom of other Kindred with this power.</p>",

Among its many uses, Auspex can detect the presence of a supernatural being who is hidden from normal sight (a vampire using Obfuscate, for example, or a ghost) or pierce illusions created by the Discipline of Chimerstry. Note: &ldquo;Normal sight&rdquo; includes regular, non-Auspex use of the Awareness skill.</p>",
        "details": "<p><strong>&bull; Obfuscate:</strong> When a vampire tries to use her heightened perceptions to notice a Kindred hidden with Obfuscate, she detects the subject&rsquo;s presence if her Auspex rating is higher than his Obfuscate, and she succeeds at a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty equals 7 minus the number of dots by which her Auspex exceeds his Obfuscate). Conversely, if the target&rsquo;s Obfuscate outranks her Auspex, he remains undiscovered. If the two ratings are equal, both characters make a resisted roll of Perception + Awareness (Auspex user) against Manipulation + Subterfuge (Obfuscate user). The difficulty for both rolls is 7, and the character with the most successes wins.<br><br><strong>&bull; Chimerstry: </strong>Likewise, vampires with Auspex may seek to penetrate illusions created with Chimerstry. The Auspex-wielder must actively seek to pierce the illusion (i.e., the player must tell the Storyteller that his character is trying to detect an illusion). The Auspex-user and Chimerstry-wielder then compare relative ratings, per Obfuscate, above. The process is otherwise identical to piercing Obfuscate.<br><br><strong>&bull; Other Powers: </strong>Since the powers of beings like magi and wraiths function differently from vampiric Disciplines, a simple comparison of relative ratings isn&rsquo;t applicable. To keep things simple, both characters make a resisted roll. The vampire rolls Perception + Awareness, while the subject rolls Manipulation + Subterfuge. Again, the difficulty is 7, and the character with the most successes wins.</p>",

Further, it is impossible to meld into earth through another substance.

It is also the method of choice for those Kindred who wish to sleep away the centuries; these vampires lock themselves in the earth&rsquo;s embrace, gaining strength and power as they rest. Superstitious and paranoid Kindred whisper that thousands of Ancients sleep within the ground and will awaken when Gehenna arrives.<br><br>While so interred, the vampire is in a transitional state between flesh and earth. His physical presence exists between the physical world and the astral plane. As such, the vampire is difficult to sense, even through supernatural means.

Similarly, digging in the material world encounters incredibly hardpacked earth, virtually as dense as stone.<br><br>Attempts at violence upon the submerged vampire from either side return him to his physical nature, expelling the soil with which he bonded in a blinding spray (all Perception-based rolls are at +2 difficulty for the turn).

Even if the desired person books the next available flight, getting to Kyoto from Milwaukee can still take far longer than the vampire needs. Obviously, the individual&rsquo;s financial resources are a factor; if he doesn&rsquo;t have the money to travel quickly, it will take him a far greater time to get there.<br><br>The subject thinks mainly of reaching the vampire, but does not neglect his own well-being. This is less of a consideration if he only has to cross a room, unless he must get through a gang of gun-wielding punks to do so. The individual retains his survival instincts, and while he won&rsquo;t shirk physical violence to reach the vampire&rsquo;s side, he won&rsquo;t subject himself to suicidal situations.<br><br>The Summoning dissipates at dawn. Unless the subject is trained to continue toward the vampire after the first call, the immortal must Summon each night until the target arrives.

The character retains no conscious connection with his vampire body during this time, though. The vampire may also venture out during the day, albeit in the animal&rsquo;s body. However, the character&rsquo;s own body must be awake to do so, requiring a successful roll to remain awake (see p. 262). If the character leaves the animal&rsquo;s body (by choice, if his body falls asleep, or after sustaining significant injury), the vampire&rsquo;s consciousness returns to his physical form instantaneously.<br><br>Although the vampire has no conscious link to his body while possessing the animal, he does form a sympathetic bond. Anything the animal feels, the vampire also experiences, from pleasure to pain. In fact, any damage the animal&rsquo;s body sustains is also applied to the character&rsquo;s body, though the Kindred body may soak as normal. If the animal dies before the vampire&rsquo;s soul can flee from the body, the character&rsquo;s body falls into torpor.

One theory holds that its secrets were taught to the Tremere by demons and that use of it brings the practitioner dangerously close to the infernal powers. A second opinion has been advanced that the Path of Corruption is a holdover from the days when Clan Tremere was still mortal. The third theory, and the most disturbing to the Tremere, is that the path originated with the Followers of Set, and that knowledge of its workings was sold to the Tremere for an unspecified price. This last rumor is vehemently denied by the Tremere, which automatically makes it a favorite topic of discussion when the matter comes up.<br><br>The Path of Corruption is primarily a mentally and spiritually oriented path centered on influencing the psyches of other individuals. It can be used neither to issue commands like Dominate nor to change emotions in the moment like Presence. Rather, it produces a gradual and subtle twisting of the subject&rsquo;s actions, morals, and thought processes. This path deals intimately with deception and dark desires, and those who work through it must understand the hidden places of the heart. Accordingly, no character may have a higher rating in the Path of Corruption than he has in Subterfuge.</p>",

Many talismans are laden with additional rituals (such as every ward known to the caster). The physical appearance of a talisman varies, but it must be a rigid object close to a yard or a meter long. Swords and walking sticks are the most common talismans, but some innovative or eccentric thaumaturges have enchanted violins, shotguns, pool cues, and classroom pointers.</p>",

Over this time, the vampire carefully prepares her talisman, carving it with Hermetic runes that signify her true name and the sum total of her thaumaturgical knowledge. The player spends one blood point per night and makes an extended roll of Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 8), one roll per week. If a night&rsquo;s work is missed or if the four rolls do not accumulate at least 20 net successes, the talisman is ruined and the process must be begun again.<br><br>A completed talisman gives the caster several advantages. When the character is holding the talisman, the difficulty of all magic that targets her is increased by one. The player receives two extra dice when rolling for uses of the character&rsquo;s primary path and one extra die when rolling for the character&rsquo;s ritual castings. If the talisman is used as a weapon, it gives the player an additional die to roll to hit. If the thaumaturge is separated from her talisman, a successful Perception + Occult roll (difficulty 7) gives her its location.<br><br>If a talisman is in the possession of another individual, it gives that individual three additional dice to roll when using any form of magic against the talisman&rsquo;s owner. At the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion, rituals that target the caster and use her talisman as a physical component may have greatly increased effects.<br><br>A thaumaturge may only have one talisman at a time.

        "description": "<p>Reminiscent of some of the powers of Vicissitude, Wither allows a vampire to cripple an opponent&rsquo;s limb. Whether the foe is living or undead, muscle shrivels away, skin peels, and bone becomes brittle. The target is unable to exert any noteworthy strength in the crippled limb. This injury lasts for far longer than most injuries trouble vampires, and in mortals it simply does not heal.<br><br>Wither doesn&rsquo;t have to be used on a limb, although that is its usual purpose. It can also be used simply to affect the target&rsquo;s face and hair, making him appear far older than his years. It could also be applied to a target&rsquo;s eye or ear, killing the sense in that organ (and thus requiring two uses to permanently blind or deafen). Wither cannot be used as an &ldquo;instant-kill&rdquo; power &mdash; necromancers cannot wither internal organs &mdash; but it can inflict a wide variety of injuries on a foe.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The player spends a Willpower point. The character chooses a limb on the target and then touches that limb. If the target is trying to avoid contact, the invoker&rsquo;s player rolls Dexterity + Brawl to hit as normal. If the character succeeds in touching the intended limb, the target suffers two aggravated wounds. Unless the target soaks both wounds (such as with Fortitude), the struck limb is crippled and unusable until both of those wounds have healed. Kindred heal the wounds as they would any other aggravated wound (see p. 285). Mortals are incapable of healing aggravated wounds, so they suffer throughout their lives unless they are healed through supernatural means. A withered limb does not degenerate further, even on a mortal. The character may be crippled for life, but the limb won&rsquo;t become infected or gangrenous.<br><br>The effects of the withering depend on the affected limb. A crippled arm has a Strength of 0, cannot benefit from Potence, and cannot carry anything heavier than about half a pound (200 grams). A crippled leg prevents the character from moving faster than a stuttering hop or dragging limp. The character suffers the effects of the Lame Flaw (see p. 482). A single withered eye or ear imposes a +1 difficulty to relevant Perception rolls. Losing both eyes or both ears imposes the effects of the Blind or Deaf Flaws (see pp. 484 and 483). A withered tongue imposes the effects of the Mute Flaw (p. 483), while a withered face reduces the target&rsquo;s Appearance by one for each aggravated wound suffered.</p>",

Instead of ravaging the target&rsquo;s body, the Assamite harrows the mind.&nbsp;<br><br><em><strong>Original - Warrior Version:</strong></em><br>This terrible power allows a vampire to drown her target in his own blood. By concentrating, the Kindred bursts her target&rsquo;s blood vessels and fills his lungs with vitae that strangles him from within. The blood actually constricts the target&rsquo;s body from the inside as it floods through his system; thus, it works even on unbreathing Kindred. Until the target collapses in agony or death throes, this power has no visible effect, and many Kindred like it because it leaves no trace of their presence.</p>",
        "details": "<p>Mechanically, this power works the same as the warrior version except as follows: First, the roll is the Assamite&rsquo;s Manipulation versus the target&rsquo;s Intelligence. The difficulty for both rolls is the other&rsquo;s permanent Willpower. Second, instead of inflicting lethal damage, each net success for the Assamite strips the target of temporary Willpower. If the Assamite spends a Willpower point and continues to roll even after the target has lost all her temporary Willpower, additional successes strip the target of one dot of permanent Willpower. This represents the most damage that this power can inflict in a single night regardless of successes, but a target who has lost all of her Willpower dots through use of Dagon&rsquo;s Call on successive nights is reduced to a mindless husk.<br><br>As with the warrior version, the Assamite need not be within the target&rsquo;s presence to trigger this attack.<br><br><em><strong>Original - Warrior Version:</strong></em><br>The vampire must touch her target prior to using Dagon&rsquo;s Call. Within an hour thereafter, the vampire may issue the call, though she need not be in the presence or even in the line of sight of her target.<br><br></p>\n<p>Invoking the power costs one Willpower point. The Kindred&rsquo;s player makes a contested Stamina roll against the target&rsquo;s Stamina; the difficulty of each roll is equal to the opponent&rsquo;s permanent Willpower rating. The number of successes the vampire using Dagon&rsquo;s Call achieves is the amount of lethal damage, in health levels, the victim suffers. For an additional point of Willpower spent in the next turn, the vampire may continue using Dagon&rsquo;s Call by engaging in another contested Stamina roll. So long as the Kindred&rsquo;s player continues to spend Willpower, the character may continue rending her opponent from within.</p>",

While the vampire needs to capture his target&rsquo;s attention, the target&rsquo;s eyes need not be present for such a power to work (although the arts of the Tzimisce make this somewhat challenging at times) &mdash; they only need to find the soul of his victim laid bare.</p>",

Several other versions of this ward exist, each geared toward a particular type of non-physical being.<br><br><br>From Ward vs. Ghouls:<br>[Wary Tremere created this ritual to protect themselves from the minions of vengeful rivals. By invoking this ritual, the caster creates a glyph that causes great pain to any ghouls who come in contact with it. The Kindred pours a point&rsquo;s worth of blood over the object he wishes to ward (a piece of parchment, a coin, a doorknob, etc.), and recites the incantation, which takes 10 minutes. In 10 hours, the magical ward is complete, and will inflict excruciating pain on any ghoul unfortunate enough to touch the warded object.]</p>",
        "details": "<p>Ward versus Spirits behaves exactly as does Ward versus Ghouls, but it affects spirits (including those summoned or given physical form by Thaumaturgy Paths such as Elemental Mastery). The material component for Ward versus Spirits is a handful of pure sea salt.<br><br>The other versions of this ward, also Level Five rituals, are Ward versus Ghosts and Ward versus Demons. Each of these three Level Five wards affects its respective target on both the physical and spiritual planes. Ward versus Ghosts requires a handful of powdered marble from a tombstone, while Ward versus Demons requires a vial of holy water.<br><br><br>From Ward vs. Ghouls:<br>[Ghouls who touch warded objects suffer three dice of lethal damage. This damage occurs again if the ghoul touches the object further; indeed, a ghoul who consciously wishes to touch a warded object must spend a point of Willpower to do so.<br><br>This ritual wards only one object &mdash; if inscribed on the side of a car, the ward affects only that door or fender, not the whole car. Wards may be placed on weapons, even bullets, though this usually works best on small-caliber weapons. Bullets often warp upon firing, however, and for a ward to remain intact on a fired round, the player needs five successes on the Firearms roll.]</p>",

The Forgetful Mind does not allow for telepathic contact; the Kindred operates much like a hypnotist, asking directed questions and drawing out answers from the subject. The degree of memory alteration depends on what the vampire desires. He may alter the subject&rsquo;s mind only slightly (quite effective for eliminating memories of the victim meeting or even being fed upon by the vampire) or utterly undo the victim&rsquo;s memories of her past.<br><br>The degree of detail used has a direct bearing on how strongly the new memories take hold, since the victim&rsquo;s subconscious mind resists the alteration. A simplistic or incomplete false memory (&ldquo;You went to the movies last night&rdquo;) crumbles much more quickly than does one with more attention to detail (&ldquo;You thought about texting your girlfriend while you were in line at the new movie theater, but you knew you&rsquo;d have to turn your phone off once you got inside. You liked the movie well enough, but the plot seemed weak. You were tired after it ended, so you went home, watched a little late-night television, and went to bed.&rdquo;).<br><br>Even in its simplest applications, The Forgetful Mind requires tremendous skill and finesse. It&rsquo;s a relatively simple matter to rifle through a victim&rsquo;s psyche and rip out the memories of the previous night without knowing what the subject did that evening. Doing so leaves a gap in the victim&rsquo;s mind, however &mdash; a hole that can give rise to further problems down the road. The Kindred may describe new memories, but these recollections seldom have the same degree of realism that the subject&rsquo;s original thoughts held.<br><br>As such, this power isn&rsquo;t always completely effective. The victim may remember being bitten, but believe it to be an animal attack. Greater memories may return in pieces as dreams, or through sensory triggers like a familiar odor or spoken phrase. Even so, months or years may pass before the subject regains enough of her lost memories to make sense of the fragments.<br><br>A vampire can also sense when a subject&rsquo;s memories were altered through use of this power, and even restore them, as a hypnotist draws forth suppressed thoughts.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This power is the basis from which all other Animalism abilities grow. The vampire creates an empathic connection with a beast, thereby allowing him to communicate or issue simple commands. The Kindred locks eyes with the animal, transmitting his desires through sheer force of will. Although it isn&rsquo;t necessary to actually &ldquo;speak&rdquo; in chirps, hisses, or barks, some vampires find that doing so helps strengthen the connection with the animal. Eye contact must be maintained the entire time; if it&rsquo;s broken, the Kindred must re-establish contact to continue communication.<br><br></p>\n<p>The simpler the creature, the more difficult it becomes to connect with the animal&rsquo;s Beast. Mammals, predatory birds, and larger reptiles are relatively easy to communicate with. Insects, invertebrates, and most fish are just too simple to connect with.<br><br></p>\n<p>Feral Whispers provides no guarantees that an animal will want to deal with the vampire, nor does it ensure that the animal will pursue any requests the vampire makes of it. Still, it does at least make the creature better disposed toward the Kindred. The manner in which the vampire presents his desires to the animal often depends on the type of creature. A Kindred can often bully smaller beasts into heeding commands, but he&rsquo;s better off couching orders for large predators as requests.<br><br></p>\n<p>If the vampire successfully uses the power, the animal performs the command to the best of its ability and intellect. Only the very brightest creatures understand truly complex directives (orders dealing with conditional situations or requiring abstract logic). Commands that the animal does understand remain deeply implanted, however, and guide its behavior for some time.</p>",
        "details": "<p>No roll is necessary to talk with an animal, but the character must establish eye contact (see p. 152) first. Issuing commands requires a Manipulation + Animal Ken roll. The difficulty depends on the creature: Predatory mammals (wolves, cats, vampire bats) are difficulty 6, other mammals and predatory birds (rats, owls) are difficulty 7, and other birds and reptiles (pigeons, snakes) are difficulty 8. This difficulty is reduced by one if the character speaks to the animal in its &ldquo;native tongue,&rdquo; and can be adjusted further by circumstances and roleplaying skill (we highly recommend that all communication between characters and animals be roleplayed).<br><br></p>\n<p>The number of successes the player achieves dictates how strongly the character&rsquo;s command affects the animal. One success is sufficient to have a cat follow an individual and lead the character to the same location, three successes are enough to have a raven spy on a target for weeks, and five successes ensure that a grizzly ferociously guards the entrance to the character&rsquo;s wilderness haven for some months.<br><br>The character&rsquo;s Nature plays a large part in how he approaches these conversations. The character might try intimidating, teasing, cajoling, or rationalizing. The player should understand that he does not simply play his character in these situations, but the Beast Within as well.<br><br></p>\n<p>Using this power cannot force an animal to do something against its nature, or to force a creature to risk its life. While the aforementioned grizzly would stand guard to the vampire&rsquo;s haven and even fight for it, it would not do so against obviously superior numbers or something overwhelmingly supernatural. A predatory bird might be convinced to harry a target, but would definitely not hold ground. A docile dog or skittish cat would have no problem with reporting something it had seen, but it wouldn&rsquo;t enter combat unless given no other option &mdash; though it would likely agree to stand and fight and then flee at the first opportunity, if a harsh Kindred demanded it.</p>",

(The two rituals, however, are mutually exclusive.) A Splinter Servant consists of a stake carved from a tree which has nourished itself on the dead. The stake must be bound in wax-sealed nightshade twine. When the binding is torn off, the Splinter Servant leaps to life, animating itself and attacking whomever the wielder commands &mdash; or the wielder, if she is too slow in assigning a target. The servant splits itself into a roughly humanoid form and begins singlemindedly trying to impale the target&rsquo;s heart. Its exertions tear it apart within a few minutes, but if it pierces its victim&rsquo;s heart before it destroys itself, it is remarkably difficult to remove, as pieces tend to remain behind if the main portion is yanked out.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The ritual requires 12 hours to cast, minus one per success, and the servant must be created<br>as described above. When the binding is torn off, the character who holds it must point the servant at its target and verbally command it to attack during the same turn. If this command is not given, the servant attacks the closest living or unliving being, usually the unfortunate individual who currently carries it.<br><br>A Splinter Servant always aims for the heart. It has an attack dice pool of the caster&rsquo;s Wits + Occult, a damage dice pool of the caster&rsquo;s Thaumaturgy rating, and a maximum movement rate of 30 yards or meters per turn. Note that these values are those of the caster who created the servant, not the individual who activates it. A Splinter Servant cannot fly, but can leap its full movement rating every turn. Every action it takes is to attack or move toward its target; it cannot dodge or split its dice pool to perform multiple attacks. The servant makes normal stake attacks that aim for the heart (difficulty 9), and its success is judged as per the rules for a normal staking (see p. 280). A Splinter Servant has three health levels, and attacks directed against it are made at +3 difficulty due to its small size and erratic movement patterns.<br><br>A Splinter Servant has an effective life of five combat turns per success rolled in its creation. If it has not impaled its victim by the last turn of its life, the servant collapses into a pile of ordinary, inanimate splinters. Three successes on a Dexterity roll (difficulty 8) are required to remove a Splinter Servant from a victim&rsquo;s heart without leaving behind shards of the stake.</p>",

Weapons so envenomed must be of the melee variety &mdash; arrows, sling stones, bullets, thrown weapons, and the like cannot carry enough of the stuff to do damage, or it drips off in flight.

The caster determines the size of the warding circle when it is cast; the default radius is 10 feet/3 meters, and every 10-foot/3-meter increase raises the difficulty by one, to a maximum of 9 (one additional success is required for every increase past the number necessary to raise the difficulty to 9). The player spends one blood point for every 10 feet/3 meters of radius and rolls. The ritual takes the normal casting time if it is to be short-term (lasting for the rest of the night) or one night if it is to be long-term (lasting a year and a day).<br><br>Once the warding circle is established, any [werewolf] who attempts to cross its boundary feels a tingle on his skin and a slight breeze on his face &mdash; a successful Intelligence + Occult roll (difficulty 8) identifies this as a warding circle. If the [werewolf] attempts to press on, he must roll more successes on a Willpower roll (difficulty of the caster&rsquo;s Thaumaturgy rating + 3) than the caster rolled when establishing the ward. Failure indicates that the ward blocks his passage and inflicts three dice of bashing damage, and his next roll to attempt to enter the circle is at +1 difficulty. If the [werewolf] leaves the circle and attempts to enter it again, he must repeat the roll. Attempts to leave the circle are not blocked.</p>",

Each power supposedly has some precedent in the parables of the ancient book, and focuses on teaching the lessons of Caine via the power of blood magic. Use of this path is hotly debated in the Sabbat, as some consider it tantamount to claiming to hold Caine&rsquo;s right over all vampires oneself. Camarilla vampires don&rsquo;t have the same knowledge of the<em> Book of Nod</em> that the Sabbat do, but the path is not entirely unheard of in Tremere chantries.<br><br>The power of this path comes not only from the magic of blood, but also incantation of verses from the <em>Book of Nod</em>. For any of these powers to take effect, the caster must speak the actual condemnation. For example, to invoke the third-level power, the caster must state plainly to his target that she may eat only ashes. The subject must generally be able to hear the caster for these powers to take effect, though writing them and showing them to the subject will do.<br><br>These powers apply to vampires only. They do not affect mortals, ghouls, or any other supernatural creatures.</p>",

Some Kindred refer to their domain as hunting grounds, and most jealously guard their domains, even invoking the Tradition of the same name to protect their claims. As part of this Background, the character&rsquo;s claim to the domain is recognized by the Prince or some other Kindred authority in the city where it is located.<br><br>The Kindred who claims the domain can&rsquo;t keep the living inhabitants from going about their business, nor does she exercise any direct influence over them, but she can keep watch herself and mind their comings and goings. She can also have Allies or Retainers specifically look for unfamiliar vampires and alert her when they find some.<br><br>Domain refers specifically to the geography (in most cases a neighborhood or street) and properties on it, as opposed to the people who may dwell there (which is the emphasis of Herd). Domain plays an important part in Kindred society &mdash; vampires who lack significant Domain seldom earn respect &mdash; but it isn&rsquo;t an automatic entitlement to status among the Damned.<br><br>You may designate one or more dots in Domain to increase the security of your character&rsquo;s territory rather than its size. Each dot so assigned to security provides a +1 difficulty penalty to efforts to intrude into the domain by anyone your character hasn&rsquo;t specifically allowed in, and a -1 difficulty bonus to efforts by your character to identify and track intruders in the domain. A Domain of one dot&rsquo;s size and two dots&rsquo; security, for instance, is small but quite resistant to intrusion, as opposed to a Domain rating of three dots&rsquo; size with no extraordinary security.&nbsp;<br><br>Each level of Domain reduces the difficulty of hunting checks by one for your character and those whom the character allows in. It also adds to your starting (not maximum) blood pool. If you use the domain security option, each dot of domain security raises the difficulty of hunting checks by one for uninvited vampires. See p. 259 for more information on hunting.<br><br></p>",

Deathsight, on the other hand, grants the necromancer the ability to see ghosts and the Shadowlands. It also shows the stain of oblivion on the living, as per Eyes of the Dead (p. 174). At the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion, the Kindred may make a similar study of an inanimate object&rsquo;s flaws and how to repair them, if that object has a strong link to either life- or death-energies (such as a murderer&rsquo;s knife or a window box used to grow healing herbs).<br><br>To perform the ritual, the necromancer grasps an obsidian mirror that has had its edge sharpened so that it cuts the flesh of whoever takes hold of it. As the vitae flows onto the mirror&rsquo;s surface, it allows the mirror&rsquo;s reflective power to bridge the worlds of the living and the dead, much as it allows the necromancer herself to do. The player then rolls to activate the ritual as normal. If successful, the Necromancer may view the world as a ghost does via the reflective surface of the mirror, for one scene.

Nearly all modern necromancers learn the Sepulchre Path first before extending their studies to other paths. The primary Necromancy path increases automatically as the character increases her overall Necromancy rating. Other paths must be bought separately, using the experience costs for secondary paths.<br><br>Like Thaumaturgy, Necromancy has also spawned a series of rituals. While not nearly so immediate in effect as the basic powers of Necromancy, Necromantic rituals can have impressive long-term effects. Unsurprisingly, the elements of Necromantic ritual are things like long-buried corpses and hands from the cadavers of hanged men, so obtaining suitable materials can be quite difficult.</p>",

Because Necromancy is not quite so rigid a study as Thaumaturgy is, the rolls required to use Necromantic powers can vary from path to path and even within individual paths. The commonly-learned Sepulchre Path is presented first, with the remaining paths presented in alphabetical order.<br><br>Statistics for ghosts may be found in Chapter Nine, p. 385.</p>",

Others move unconsciously to avoid contact with the cloaked creature; those with weak wills may even scurry away from the area in unacknowledged fear. The vampire remains ignored indefinitely unless someone deliberately seeks him out or he inadvertently reveals himself.<br><br>Since the vampire fully retains his physical substance, he must be careful to avoid contact with anything that may disclose his presence (knocking over a vase, bumping into someone). Even a whispered word or the scuffing of a shoe against the floor can be enough to disrupt the power.</p>",
        "details": "<p>No roll is necessary to use this power unless the character speaks, attacks, or otherwise draws attention to himself. The Storyteller should call for a Wits + Stealth roll under any circumstances that might cause the character to reveal himself. The difficulty of the roll depends on the situation; stepping on a squeaky floorboard might be a 5, while walking through a pool of water may require a 9. Other acts may require a certain number of successes; speaking quietly without giving away one&rsquo;s position, for instance, demands at least three successes. Upon success, the vampire, all her clothing, and objects that could fit into a pocket are concealed.<br><br>Some things are beyond the power of Unseen Presence to conceal. Although the character is cloaked from view while he smashes through a window, yells out, or throws someone across the room, the vampire becomes visible to all in the aftermath. Bystanders snap out of the subtle fugue in which Obfuscate put them. Worse still, each viewer can make a Wits + Awareness roll (difficulty 7); if successful, the mental haze clears completely, so those individuals recall every move the character made up until then as if he had been visible the entire time.</p>",

This Thaumaturgical path enables powerful conjurations limited only by the mind of the practitioner.<br><br>Objects summoned via this path bear two distinct characteristics. They are uniformly &ldquo;generic&rdquo; in that each object summoned, if summoned again, would look exactly as it did at first. For example, a knife would be precisely the same knife if created twice; the two would be indistinguishable. Even a specific knife &mdash; the one a character&rsquo;s father used to threaten her &mdash; would appear identical every time it was conjured. A rat would have repeated &ldquo;tiled&rdquo; patterns over its fur, and a garbage can would have a completely uniform fluted texture over its surface. Additionally, conjured objects bear no flaws: Weapons have no dents or scratches, tools have no distinguishing marks, and cellphones all look like they just came out of their packaging.<br><br>The limit on the size of conjured objects appears to be that of the conjurer: nothing larger than the thaumaturge can be created. The conjurer must also have some degree of familiarity with the object he wishes to call forth. Simply working from a picture or imagination calls for a higher difficulty, while objects with which the character is intimately familiar (such as the knife described above) may actually lower the difficulty, at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion.<br><br>When a player rolls to conjure something, the successes gained on the roll indicate the quality of the summoned object.

No one can identify the casting language, but according to the ritual&rsquo;s oblique history, the language is what God gave humankind before the confusion of Babel. The legend further states that while the particular meaning of the words is lost, they are what Caine&rsquo;s father said to him while exiling him to Nod.<br><br>Regardless of the truth of the matter, the Words of Exile are not spoken lightly. When the ritual is cast successfully, it opens a hole within reality itself &mdash; a rip between the lands of the living and the darkest depths of the Underworld. This tear is invisible to normal vision, but to Witness of Death or Shroudsight it looks like a black vortex opening within the vampire&rsquo;s own body (the very few unfortunate enough to look into the gap with high levels of Auspex are generally unwilling or unable to discuss it). Any ghost clutched to the Kindred&rsquo;s chest is instantly torn to shreds. Grabbing a ghost in this fashion requires a Clinch or Tackle maneuver. Destroyed spirits don&rsquo;t come back for at least a month, if ever. A wraith destroyed in this fashion tends to return as a Spectre, if it returns at all.<br><br>The necromancer may clutch and destroy a number of spirits equal to the number of successes she rolled. After that, the vortex closes. It closes at the end of the scene if it hasn&rsquo;t already.<br><br>Of course, using one&rsquo;s body as a portal between our world and what some people might call Hell is neither simple nor healthy. For starters, it costs a blood point and a point of Willpower (which does not give an automatic success on the ritual roll). More importantly, each success rolled inflicts a level of unsoakable lethal damage on the necromancer. Most significantly, every use of <em>Esilio</em> permanently reduces the necromancer&rsquo;s Humanity by one point if he follows that morality, and may impact other Paths at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion.</p>",

This cloud of virulence is completely invisible to anyone without the ability to see the passing of entropy. The energy of this cloud is like a beacon for Spectres, and they are drawn to the entropic force like moths to a flame.<br><br>Once the energy is pulled from the necromancer&rsquo;s body, she can either disperse it over a large area as a lure for Spectres, or use the mist for more sinister purposes. Channeled into an object or person, the deathmist inflicts the subject with a debilitating, wasting illness. Furthermore, the focused energies are tainted and eerie, and though generally invisible (except to powers such as Aura Perception), they tend to cause people and animals to feel uncomfortable around the victim.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The player spends one blood point and rolls Willpower (difficulty 8). Only one success is needed to draw out the Breath of Thanatos. If dispersed to summon Spectres, the energies cover roughly one-quarter of a mile (400 meters) in radius, centered around the necromancer. The range increases by an additional one-quarter mile or 400 meters for every additional blood point expended.<br><br>Spectres summoned with this power will ignore the summoning necromancer for the duration of the power unless provoked, but may well go out of their way to wreak havoc on anyone else in the vicinity. The necromancer can then use other Necromancy powers (such as those in the Sepulchre Path) to manipulate and affect these Spectres. Ghosts so targeted may then interact with the necromancer as normal, although the other Spectres in the area will continue to ignore both the vampire and the targeted ghost. This energy disperses after a scene, after which the Spectres leave to find new prey. Mechanics for Spectres can be found on p. 385.<br><br>If the cloud is directed toward a particular target, the necromancer must either touch the target or direct the stream of entropy using Dexterity + Occult (difficulty 7). A target laden with entropy suffers one (and only one) level of aggravated damage; this generally manifests as sudden illness or decay. The target&rsquo;s social difficulties while interacting with those unfamiliar with the touch of death &mdash; most normal humans, as well as some supernatural creatures &mdash; increase by 2. Furthermore, supernatural perceptions indicate the target is tainted with decay, which can be dangerous. This form of taint lasts until sunrise; a victim already plagued by this power cannot be affected again until the previous fog of entropy has dispersed.<br><br>A botch on the roll to control this power indicates that the vampire has turned the energy upon himself, and suffers all the effects of the vitriolic breath. This inflicts the usual injury and may subject the necromancer to the possibly dangerous attention of provoked Spectres and other creatures from beyond the grave.</p>",

The Storyteller should impose a bonus (-1 or -2 difficulty) for relatively minor shifts, such as clearing away a light drizzle or calling lightning when a severe thunderstorm is already raging. Conversely, a penalty (+1 or +2 difficulty) should be applied when the desired change is at odds with the current conditions, such as summoning the same light drizzle in the middle of the Sahara Desert or calling down lightning from a cloudless sky.<br><br>If the character tries to strike a specific target with lightning, the player must roll Perception + Occult (difficulty 6 if the target is standing in open terrain, 8 if he is under shelter, or 10 if he is inside but near a window) in addition to the base roll to use Thaumaturgy. Otherwise the bolt goes astray, with the relative degree of failure of the roll determining where exactly the lightning strikes.<br><br>Effects of the power default to the maximum area available unless the caster states that he&rsquo;s attempting to affect a smaller area. At Storyteller discretion, an additional Willpower roll (difficulty 6) may be required to keep the change in the weather under control.<br><br>Weather Control is not the sort of power that lends itself well to indoor application. While certain of the path&rsquo;s uses (changes of temperature, high winds, and possibly even fog) do make a certain amount of sense in interior settings, others (precipitation of any sort, lightning) don&rsquo;t. The difficulty for all rolls to use Weather Control indoors is at +2, and the Storyteller should feel free to disallow any proposed uses that don&rsquo;t make sense.<br><br>Individual power descriptions are not provided for this path, as the general principle is fairly consistent.

In addition, the difficulty on all Drive rolls increases by two.<br><br>&bull;&bull;&bull; <strong>High Winds: </strong>The wind speed rises to around 30 miles per hour or 50 kilometers per hour, with gusts of up to twice that. Ranged attacks are much more difficult: + 1 to firearm attacks and +2 to thrown weapons and archery. In addition, during fierce gusts, Dexterity rolls (difficulty 6) may be required to keep characters from being knocked over by the winds. When gale-force winds are in effect, papers go flying, objects get picked up by the winds and hurled with abandon, and other suitably cinematic effects are likely. Moderate temperature change: The local temperature can be raised or lowered by up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit or 10 degrees Celsius.<br><br>&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull; <strong>Storm: </strong>This has the effects of both Rain and High Winds.<br><br>&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;<strong> Lightning Strike: </strong>This attack inflicts 10 dice of lethal damage.

It is, however, helpful in determine the target&rsquo;s emotional state, which might lead the vampire to decide that a particular target is suspicious.<br><br>A character may choose to perform a very cursory aura scan of a large area like a nightclub&rsquo;s dance floor or the audience in a gallery. In this case, the player decides which characteristic of auras she&rsquo;s looking for, and that&rsquo;s the only information she&rsquo;s able to glean if the roll is successful. (At the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion, on this general scan roll, more successes on the roll may more quickly yield what the character seeks.) For example, the player may specify, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the most nervous person in attendance?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are there any vampirically pale auras among the CEO&rsquo;s entourage?&rdquo; Thereafter, the player may narrow down her scrutiny of a single individual, with an additional roll as normal.<br><br>The character may focus in on a particular subject&rsquo;s aura only once per scene with any degree of clarity. Any subsequent attempts that result in failure should be considered botches. It is very easy for the character to imagine seeing what she wants to see when judging someone&rsquo;s intentions. After 24 hours, the character may try again at no penalty.<br><br>It is possible, though difficult, to sense the aura of a being who is otherwise invisible to normal sight.

If the necromancer already knows any of the ghosts involved, their ties are revealed with their identity &mdash; so, if the necromancer already knows a wraith well enough to summon and compel it with other powers, successful identification of a fetter tells whether the object is tied to that ghost, in addition to any other impressions gained.<br><br>If a botch is scored, the necromancer can never successfully use this power on the item being examined.</p>",

In addition, unlike most Disciplines, some of Presence&rsquo;s powers can be used on entire crowds at one time. Presence can transcend race, religion, gender, class, and (most importantly) supernatural nature. As such, this subtle power is one of the most useful Disciplines a vampire can possess.<br><br>Anyone can resist Presence for one scene by spending a Willpower point and succeeding on a Willpower roll (difficulty 8), but the affected individual must keep spending points until he is no longer in the presence of the vampire (or, in the case of Summon, until the effect wears off). Vampires three or more Generations lower than the wielder need only spend a single Willpower to ignore the Presence for an entire night and need not roll Willpower to do so.<br><br></p>\n<p>The major drawback of Presence is that it controls only the emotions. It causes others to feel a certain way toward the vampire, but does not give her outright control over them. While people weigh strongly the orders that the vampire declares, their minds are still their own. Suicidal or ridiculous directives don&rsquo;t sound any more sensible just because the person giving them is unusually fascinating. Still, inspired eloquence or significant wealth used in combination with this Discipline can enable the vampire to urge others along a desired course.<br><br>The Brujah, Followers of Set, Toreador, and Ventrue Clans are all adept in this Discipline. The Ventrue are arguably the most skilled with its application, however, due to their ability to use Presence and Dominate in efficient combination.</p>",

These tentacles, combined with the bands of darkness all over the Kindred&rsquo;s body, subtract two dice from the Stamina and soak dice pools of opponents physically touched in combat, for as long as the vampire remains in contact with the victim. This is not cumulative with other powers in Obtenebration, although targets can asphyxiate at Stamina 0, as per Shadow Play. The vampire may make an additional attack without penalty by using the tentacles (for a total of two attacks, not one additional attack per tentacle). Additionally, the vampire can sense his surroundings fully even in pitch darkness.<br><br>The vampire&rsquo;s head and extremities sometimes appear to fade away into nothingness, while at other times they seem swathed in otherworldly darkness. This, combined with the wriggling tentacles writhing from his body, creates an unsettling sight. Mortals, animals, and other creatures not accustomed to this sort of display must make Courage rolls (difficulty 8) or succumb to a panic that amounts to R&ouml;tschreck (though it is inspired by the darkness rather than fire).

The Discipline is, fundamentally, an art of conjuration that converts the vampire&rsquo;s will into phantoms that confound the senses and technology alike. Even vampires fall under the sway of the Ravnos&rsquo; illusory world, unless they have a strong enough grasp of Auspex (see p. 142). The Ravnos often use this power to swindle and seduce their victims into acts that work out badly for the victim (but great for the Ravnos).<br><br>Illusions created by Chimerstry can be seen for what they are by a victim who &ldquo;proves&rdquo; the illusion&rsquo;s falsehood (e.g., a person who walks up to an illusory wall, expresses his disbelief in it, and puts his hand through it effectively banishes the illusion), and explicitly incredible illusions are seen as false immediately (e.g., dragons breathing fire or gravity working in reverse). Sometimes, frequent targets of Chimerstry end up attempting to disbelieve everything around them, leading to derangements (and, quite often, to the amusement of the Ravnos).</p>",

To use a bite attack, the vampire must first perform a successful clinch, hold, or tackle maneuver (see below). On the turn following the successful attack, the player may declare the bite attempt and make a roll using the modifiers below.\n\nAlternatively, a player can declare her vampire’s bite to be a “Kiss” attack. A Kiss is resolved in the same way as a normal bite, but inflicts no health levels of damage. Upon connecting with a Kiss, the vampire may begin to drain the victim’s blood at the normal rate, and the victim is typically helpless to resist (see p. 269 for specifics). Following the Kiss, a vampire may, if she chooses, lick the puncture wound of the Kiss closed, thereby removing any evidence that she has fed.",

Until the target collapses in agony or death throes, this power has no visible effect, and many Kindred like it because it leaves no trace of their presence.</p>",

The difficulty for both rolls is the other&rsquo;s permanent Willpower. Second, instead of inflicting lethal damage, each net success for the Assamite strips the target of temporary Willpower. If the Assamite spends a Willpower point and continues to roll even after the target has lost all her temporary Willpower, additional successes strip the target of one dot of permanent Willpower. This represents the most damage that this power can inflict in a single night regardless of successes, but a target who has lost all of her Willpower dots through use of Dagon&rsquo;s Call on successive nights is reduced to a mindless husk.<br><br>As with the warrior version, the Assamite need not be within the target&rsquo;s presence to trigger this attack.<br><br><br><em><strong>Original - Warrior Version:</strong></em><br>The vampire must touch her target prior to using Dagon&rsquo;s Call. Within an hour thereafter, the vampire may issue the call, though she need not be in the presence or even in the line of sight of her target.<br><br></p>\n<p>Invoking the power costs one Willpower point. The Kindred&rsquo;s player makes a contested Stamina roll against the target&rsquo;s Stamina; the difficulty of each roll is equal to the opponent&rsquo;s permanent Willpower rating. The number of successes the vampire using Dagon&rsquo;s Call achieves is the amount of lethal damage, in health levels, the victim suffers. For an additional point of Willpower spent in the next turn, the vampire may continue using Dagon&rsquo;s Call by engaging in another contested Stamina roll. So long as the Kindred&rsquo;s player continues to spend Willpower, the character may continue rending her opponent from within.</p>",

This pernicious influence is extremely virulent among mortals. They pick the disease up simply by spending a few hours near the victim. Other vampires have a harder time acquiring the disease.

If the player scores more successes than the victim, he acquires a virulent disease immediately. The disease has the following effects:<br><br>&bull; The victim&rsquo;s Strength and Wits are halved (round down).<br><br>&bull; The victim loses one point of Dexterity.</p>\n<p><br>&bull; The victim&rsquo;s player must spend one additional blood point every evening for the vampire to rouse himself to consciousness.

On a failure, the vampire cannot keep the blood he just ingested inside his body, and he vomits it up in great horrifying gouts of gore, losing any benefit the blood might have provided. Humans vomit up food.<br><br>Every evening at sunset, the victim has a chance to throw off the plague. The victim&rsquo;s player rolls Stamina, with a difficulty equal to 10 minus the number of sunsets since acquiring the plague. On a successful roll, the character fights the disease to a standstill and begins to recover.

        "description": "<p>Command over the weather has long been a staple power of wizards both mortal and immortal, and this path is said to predate the Tremere by millennia. The proliferation of usage of this path outside the Clan tends to confirm this theory; Weather Control is quite common outside the Tremere, and even outside the Camarilla. Lower levels of this path allow subtle manipulations, while higher stages of mastery allow a vampire to call up raging storms. The area affected by this power is usually rather small, no more than three or four miles (five to six kilometers) in diameter, and the changes the power wreaks are not always immediate.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The number of successes rolled indicates how long it takes the weather magic to take effect. One success indicates an entire day may pass before the weather changes to the thaumaturge&rsquo;s liking, while a roll with five successes brings an almost instant effect.<br><br>The difficulty of the Willpower roll necessary to invoke this power may change depending on the current local weather conditions and the weather the character is attempting to create. The Storyteller should impose a bonus (-1 or -2 difficulty) for relatively minor shifts, such as clearing away a light drizzle or calling lightning when a severe thunderstorm is already raging. Conversely, a penalty (+1 or +2 difficulty) should be applied when the desired change is at odds with the current conditions, such as summoning the same light drizzle in the middle of the Sahara Desert or calling down lightning from a cloudless sky.<br><br>If the character tries to strike a specific target with lightning, the player must roll Perception + Occult (difficulty 6 if the target is standing in open terrain, 8 if he is under shelter, or 10 if he is inside but near a window) in addition to the base roll to use Thaumaturgy. Otherwise the bolt goes astray, with the relative degree of failure of the roll determining where exactly the lightning strikes.<br><br>Effects of the power default to the maximum area available unless the caster states that he&rsquo;s attempting to affect a smaller area. At Storyteller discretion, an additional Willpower roll (difficulty 6) may be required to keep the change in the weather under control.<br><br>Weather Control is not the sort of power that lends itself well to indoor application. While certain of the path&rsquo;s uses (changes of temperature, high winds, and possibly even fog) do make a certain amount of sense in interior settings, others (precipitation of any sort, lightning) don&rsquo;t. The difficulty for all rolls to use Weather Control indoors is at +2, and the Storyteller should feel free to disallow any proposed uses that don&rsquo;t make sense.<br><br>Individual power descriptions are not provided for this path, as the general principle is fairly consistent. Instead, the strongest weather phenomenon possible at each level is listed.<br><br>&bull; <strong>Fog:</strong> Vision is slightly impaired and sounds are muffled; a +1 difficulty is imposed on all Perception rolls that involve sight and hearing, and the effective range of all ranged attacks are halved.</p>\n<p><strong>Light breeze:</strong> A +1 difficulty is imposed on all Perception rolls that involve smell.<br>Minor temperature change: It is possible to raise or lower the local temperature by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit or 5 degrees Celsius.<br><br>&bull;&bull; <strong>Rain or snow:</strong> As Fog, but Perception rolls are impaired to a much greater extent; the difficulty modifier for all such rolls rises to +2. In addition, the difficulty on all Drive rolls increases by two.<br><br>&bull;&bull;&bull; <strong>High Winds: </strong>The wind speed rises to around 30 miles per hour or 50 kilometers per hour, with gusts of up to twice that. Ranged attacks are much more difficult: + 1 to firearm attacks and +2 to thrown weapons and archery. In addition, during fierce gusts, Dexterity rolls (difficulty 6) may be required to keep characters from being knocked over by the winds. When gale-force winds are in effect, papers go flying, objects get picked up by the winds and hurled with abandon, and other suitably cinematic effects are likely. Moderate temperature change: The local temperature can be raised or lowered by up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit or 10 degrees Celsius.<br><br>&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull; <strong>Storm: </strong>This has the effects of both Rain and High Winds.<br><br>&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;<strong> Lightning Strike: </strong>This attack inflicts 10 dice of lethal damage. Body armor does not add to the target&rsquo;s dice pool to soak this attack.</p>",

The eye is ritually prepared in a process involving incense, the new moon, and a period of midnight chanting. The chanting climaxes when the necromancer removes one of her own eyes and replaces it with the one from the corpse (fresher is better). Kindred healing takes over at that point, sealing the eye within the socket.<br><br>If the ritual succeeds, the Necromancer permanently gains the Shroudsight ability (see p. 163). This ability is always active and does not require a roll.<br><br>Furthermore, if it was a Spectre&rsquo;s corpse, the vampire can hear the vague murmuring of any Spectres in the area. This ability isn&rsquo;t very precise; rather than mind reading, it&rsquo;s more like trying to overhear a low-voiced conversation in the next room. With a Perception + Occult roll, the Necromancer can glean a very vague impression of what nearby Spectres are up to. Botching this roll may well earn the necromancer a new derangement (at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion), as the whispers creep into the caster&rsquo;s subconscious.<br><br>This ritual has some major drawbacks, the first being that its proper result is hideously ugly. Unless the vampire wears sunglasses or finds some other way to conceal her eye, her Appearance is reduced by one dot.<br><br>Also, dead or rotted tissue is not the best for normal perception. Any mundane visual Perception rolls are at +1 difficulty (possibly more if the corpse had bad eyesight in life). On the other hand, since the eye offers a window into a different soul than the necromancer, it offers some protection against powers requiring eye contact. These Disciplines are used against the deadeyed necromancer at +1 difficulty.<br><br>Most importantly, however, the ghost whose body was desecrated knows it, and very likely<em> hates</em> it.

Soul Feasting allows the caster to either draw on the ambient death energies around her or to actively feed on a ghost, stealing the wraith&rsquo;s substance and mystically transforming that energy into sustenance.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The player spends one Willpower point to allow the vampire to feed on the negative energies of the dead. If the character is drawing the energies from the atmosphere, she must be in a place where death has occurred within the hour or in a place where death is common, such as a cemetery, a morgue, or the scene of a recent murder. Generally, the necromancer can draw anywhere from one to four points of entropy from such a location, although the difficulty in using all Necromancy and similar deathly powers within the area increases by an equal amount for a number of nights equal to the points taken. The energies of such an area may only be drained once until the area&rsquo;s entropy replenishes.<br><br>In cases when the necromancer feeds on a ghost, the vampire must actually attack the wraith as if feeding normally. Wraiths have up to 10 &ldquo;blood points&rdquo; that may be taken from them, and they become less and less substantial as their spirit essence drains away. The character is vulnerable to any attack the ghost might make, even those that do not normally affect the physical world; while feeding, the vampire is essentially in a half-state, existing in both the living lands and the Underworld simultaneously. The wraith so attacked is considered immobilized and cannot run or escape unless it can defeat the vampire in a resisted Willpower roll (difficulty 6 for both sides). This power may also be used in conjunction with Ash Path Necromancy, allowing the vampire to drain power (though not sustenance) from ghosts while traveling in the lands of the dead.<br><br>This soul energy may be used just like blood in every respect except for when the vampire rises for the night. It can activate Disciplines, heal wounds, boost Attributes, etc. Botching this power renders the vampire unable to feed through the Shroud for the rest of the night. However, she remains susceptible to the assaults of ghosts and spirits for several turns (generally, a number of turns equal to the amount of energy that could have been drawn from the area, or one turn if attacking a ghost) as she hovers between worlds, unable to function effectively in either.</p>",

The player spends one blood point for every 10 feet/3 meters of radius and rolls.

Failure indicates that the ward blocks his passage and inflicts three dice of bashing damage, and his next roll to attempt to enter the circle is at +1 difficulty.

Blood from a cold corpse has been transubstantiated into a dead form &mdash; a cold incarnation of a hot, wet element. This transformation of the living into death holds great power; the necromancer knows how to infuse her own being with the blood of a cold corpse and transform herself into something not wholly vampiric. Instead, the necromancer edges closer to being an animated corpse in fact as well as name. She grows distant and chill, as though possessed by the spirit of Death itself; she has to work to push her attention into the physical world.occu</p>",
        "details": "<p>The character must drink, and then spend, five blood points from a cold corpse (one dead for 24 hours or more, but generally less than three days). It will generally take at least two turns to consume that blood, and the power is not activated until the character can spend all of it. For example, if the character is Twelfth Generation, Clutching the Shroud takes at least seven turns total to activate (two to consume the blood and five to spend it).<br><br>After the power is active and for the rest of the scene, the necromancer gains several benefits. First, she receives two additional soak dice, which may be used to soak any sort of damage, even if the character does not possess Fortitude. Second, she gains a mystic sense of how far those in the area are from death &mdash; whether they are healthy or infirm, suffer from diseases, or are undead, ghouls, or mortals. Finally, a Manipulation + Occult roll lets her speak with ghosts freely. The difficulty for this roll depends on how attuned to death a locale is; a cemetery would be difficulty 5, while a cozy apartment might be difficulty 7. However, this ability makes the necromancer much more susceptible to the effects of powers used by ghosts, which means that she must act carefully.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Thaumaturgy encompasses blood magic and other sorcerous arts available to Kindred. The Tremere Clan is best known for their possession (and jealous hoarding) of this Discipline. The Tremere created Thaumaturgy by combining mortal wizardry with the power of vampiric vitae, and as a result it is a versatile and powerful Discipline. Although there are whispers of the existence of Tremere antitribu in the Sabbat, other Clans in the Sword of Caine have also researched and developed access to such mystical might. Nevertheless, the Tremere of the Camarilla remain this Discipline&rsquo;s masters.<br><br>Like Necromancy, the practice of Thaumaturgy is divided into paths and rituals. Thaumaturgical paths are applications of the vampire&rsquo;s knowledge of blood magic, allowing her to create effects on a whim. Rituals are more formulaic in nature, most akin to ancient magical &ldquo;spells.&rdquo; Because so many different paths and rituals are available to the arcane Tremere, one never knows what to expect when confronted with a practitioner of this Discipline.<br><br>When a character first learns Thaumaturgy, the player selects a path for the character. That path is considered the character&rsquo;s primary path, and she automatically receives one dot in it, as well as one Level One ritual. Thereafter, whenever the character increases her level in Thaumaturgy, her rating in the primary path increases by one as well. Additional rituals are learned separately, as part of a story; players need not pay experience points for their characters to learn rituals up to the level equal to their overall rating in Thaumaturgy, though they must find someone to teach the rituals in question. Path ratings never exceed 5, though the overall Thaumaturgy score may. If a character reaches a rating of 5 in her primary path and increases her Thaumaturgy score afterward, she may allocate her &ldquo;free&rdquo; path dot to a different path. (Experience costs are covered on p. 124.)<br><br>Many Kindred fear crossing the practitioners of Thaumaturgy. It is a very potent and mutable Discipline, and almost anything the Kindred wishes may be accomplished through its magic.</p>",
        "details": "<h2>Thaumaturgical Paths</h2>\n<p>Paths define the types of magic a vampire can perform. A vampire typically learns his primary path from his sire, though it is not unknown for some vampires to study under many different tutors.<br><br>As mentioned before, the first path a character learns is considered her primary path and increases automatically as the character advances in the Discipline itself. Secondary paths may be learned once the character has acquired two or more dots in her primary path, and they must be raised separately with experience points. Furthermore, a character&rsquo;s rating in her primary path must always be at least one dot higher than any of her secondary paths until she has mastered her primary path. Once the character has achieved the fifth level of her primary path, secondary paths may be increased to that level.<br><br>Each time the character invokes one of the powers of a Thaumaturgical path, the thaumaturge&rsquo;s player must spend a blood point and make a Willpower roll against a difficulty equal to the power&rsquo;s level +3. Only one success is required to invoke a path&rsquo;s effect &mdash; path levels, not successes, govern the power of blood magic. Failure on this roll indicates that the magic fails. A botch causes some kind of loss or catastrophic backfire, such as losing a Willpower point (or dot!), spontaneous combustion, or accidentally letting a living statue run rampant. Thaumaturgy is an unforgiving art.<br><br>Various Sects and Clans have different access to each path, but unless the Storyteller decides otherwise, it is assumed the Tremere have some access to all of them. (&ldquo;Having access&rdquo; does not mean the same thing as &ldquo;easily gained,&rdquo; especially within the Tremere power structure.) The paths start with one of the most common (The Path of Blood), and thereafter are presented in alphabetical order. (The unusual &ldquo;path&rdquo; of Thaumaturgical Countermagic is also presented, although it is considered a separate Discipline &ndash; see p. 228 for details.)</p>",

The Kindred &ldquo;hears&rdquo; in her own mind the thoughts plucked from a subject as if they were spoken to her.<br><br>This is one of the most potent vampiric abilities, since, given time, a Kindred can learn virtually anything from a subject without him ever knowing. The Tremere and Tzimisce in particular find this power especially useful in gleaning secrets from others, or for directing their mortal followers with silent precision.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The player rolls Intelligence + Subterfuge (difficulty of the subject&rsquo;s current Willpower points). Projecting thoughts into the target&rsquo;s mind requires one success. The subject recognizes that the thoughts come from somewhere other than his own consciousness, though he cannot discern their actual origin without a successful Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty equal to the vampire&rsquo;s Manipulation + Subterfuge).<br><br>To read minds, one success must be rolled for each item of information plucked or each layer of thought pierced. Deep secrets or buried memories are harder to obtain than surface emotions or unspoken comments, requiring five or more successes to access.<br><br>Reading thoughts with Telepathy does not commonly work upon the undead mind. A character may expend a Willpower point to make the effort, making the roll normally afterward. Likewise, it is equally difficult to read the thoughts of other supernatural creatures. However, the character may project her thoughts without expending a Willpower point. These thoughts, however, are still obviously intrusions into the target&rsquo;s mind, but the character may attempt to disguise her mental &ldquo;voice&rdquo; with a roll of Manipulation + Subterfuge (difficulty equals the target&rsquo;s Perception + Awareness) so the target doesn&rsquo;t recognize her as the &ldquo;speaker.&rdquo;<br><br>Storytellers are encouraged to describe thoughts as flowing streams of impressions and images, rather than as a sequence of prose (powers such as Telepathic Communication are of more use for that). Instead of making flat statements like &ldquo;He&rsquo;s planning on killing his former lover&rsquo;s new boyfriend,&rdquo; say &ldquo;You see a fleeting series of visions: A couple kissing passionately in a doorway, then the man walking alone at night; you suddenly see your hands, knuckles white, wrapped around a steering wheel, with a figure crossing the street ahead; your heart, mortal now and hammering with panic as you hear the engine rev wildly; and above all, a blazing anger coupled with emotional agony and a panicked fear of loss.&rdquo; Such descriptions not only add to the story, but they also force the player to interpret for herself what her character gleans. After all, understanding minds &mdash; especially highly emotional or deranged minds &mdash; is a difficult and often puzzling task.</p>",

The difficulty depends on the intricacy of the pattern. Discerning the Nature of a stranger would be difficulty 9, a casual acquaintance would be an 8, and an established ally a 6. The vampire could also read the message locked in a coded missive (difficulty 7), or even see the doings of an invisible hand in such events as the pattern of falling leaves (difficulty 6). Almost anything might contain some hidden insight, no matter how trivial or meaningless. The patterns are present in most things, but are often so intricate they can keep a vampire spellbound for hours while she tries to understand their message.<br><br>This is a potent power, subject to adjudication. Storytellers, this power is an effective way to introduce plot threads for a chronicle, reveal an overlooked clue, foreshadow important events, or communicate critical information a player seeks. Important to its use, though, is delivering the information properly. Secrets revealed via Eyes of Chaos are never simple facts; they&rsquo;re tantalizing symbols adrift in a sea of madness.

Only a foolish vampire ignores the potential threat such human beings represent. (See p. 372 for more information about True Faith, for example.)<br><br>&bull; Vampires: It is impossible to Dominate another Kindred who is of stronger Blood. The vampire must be of an equal or higher Generation than the target for the powers to be effective. Scholars of the Kindred condition suspect that this is one of the protections Caine put in place to protect himself from the whims of his willful childer. A faction of those who believe this theory also maintain that this implies that Caine himself employed the Discipline of Dominate.<br><br>&bull; Nature: A character&rsquo;s Nature can have a distinct impact on how easily Dominate influences her. A vampire might easily control subjects with inherently empathic Natures (Caregiver, Child, Conformist), while those whose Natures denote a great degree of inner strength (Bravo, Director, Rebel) can be more of a challenge. The Storyteller may reduce the required difficulty or number of successes by one or two when the player rolls against those subjects with &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; Natures, or raise them by a similar amount for &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; Natures. On the other hand, &ldquo;strong&rdquo; Natures might be more easiliy influenced to take aggressive actions &mdash; for example, coaxing a Rebel to denounce the Prince is likely easier than goading a Conformist to do the same thing. Ultimately, the Storyteller must adjudicate.<br><br>&bull; Botches: If a Dominate roll botches, the target is rendered immune to future attempts by the same vampire for the rest of the story.</p>",

Oddly enough, this ritual almost never takes in any tool that the caster finds himself needing during the assistant&rsquo;s lifespan, nor does it take the physical components of any other ritual nor any living thing. The servant has no personality to speak of at first, but gradually adopts the mannerisms and thought processes that the thaumaturge desires in an ideal servant.

A Sanguine Assistant is a naturally timid creature and flees if attacked, though it will try to defend its master&rsquo;s life at the cost of its own. It has no Disciplines of its own, but has a full understanding of all of its master&rsquo;s Thaumaturgical knowledge and can instruct others if so commanded.

        "details": "<p>The player rolls Charisma + Leadership (difficulty equal to the target&rsquo;s current Willpower points) once per scene. Conditioning is an extended action, for which the Storyteller secretly determines the number of successes required. It typically requires between five and 10 times the subject&rsquo;s Self-Control/Instinct rating. Targets with more empathic Natures may require a lower number of successes, while those with willful Natures require a higher total. Only through roleplaying may a character discern whether his subject is conditioned successfully.<br><br>A target may become more tractable even before becoming fully conditioned. Once the vampire accumulates half the required number of successes, the Storyteller may apply a lower difficulty to the vampire&rsquo;s subsequent uses of Dominate. After being conditioned, the target falls so far under the vampire&rsquo;s influence that the Kindred need not make eye contact or even be present to retain absolute control. The subject does exactly as she is told (including taking actions that would injure herself), as long as her master can communicate with her verbally. No command roll is necessary unless the subject is totally isolated from the vampire&rsquo;s presence (in a different room, over the phone). Even if a command roll fails, the target will still likely carry out part of the orders given, simply because her master wishes it.<br><br>After the subject is fully conditioned, other Kindred find her more difficult to Dominate. Such conditioning raises others&rsquo; difficulties by two (to a maximum of 10).<br><br>It is possible, though difficult, to shake Conditioning. The subject must be separated entirely from the vampire to whom she was in thrall. This period of separation varies depending on the individual, but the Storyteller may set it at six months, less a number of weeks equal to the subject&rsquo;s permanent Willpower rating (so a person with 5 Willpower must stay away from the vampire for just under five months). The subject regains her personality slowly during this time, though she may still lapse into brief spells of listlessness, despair, or even anger. If the vampire encounters the target before that time passes, a single successful Charisma + Leadership roll (difficulty of the target&rsquo;s current Willpower points) on the part of the vampire completely reasserts the dominance.<br><br>If the subject makes it through the time period without intervention by her master, the target regains her former individuality. Even so, the vampire may reestablish conditioning more easily than the first time, since the subject is now predisposed to falling under the Kindred&rsquo;s mental control. New attempts require half the total number of successes than the last bout of conditioning did (which means the subject reaches the threshold for reduced difficulties sooner, as well).</p>",

Over time, though, a necromancer can become sensitized to the pull that occurs when a soul escapes from a body only to hover in wait, enslaved by its desires. The weight of desperation becomes like a tangible tug, and some necromancers savor this emotion even as they follow the sensation to find the new ghost.<br><br>Of course, actually discovering the new ghost can be problematic.

With five successes, the necromancer immediately senses the location of the new ghost to within one foot or 30 cm. A failure carries no penalty but a botched attempt sends the necromancer scurrying off in the wrong direction.<br><br>The Storyteller may rule that disturbances in the Underworld, intervening magic, or other similar phenomena cloud this sensation, simply to prevent overburdening a chronicle with constant ghost-hunting and dice rolling.</p>",

In nights of yore, when Assamites led the charges of Saracen legions, the Assassins were often seen licking their blades, slicing open their tongues and lubricating their weapons with this foul secretion.<br><br>Baal&rsquo;s Caress may be used to augment any bladed weapon; everything from poisoned knives and swords to tainted fingernails and claws has been reported.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The viziers are rarely as eager to slay their opponents as the warriors are. Subjugation is much more desirable. The vizier may coat a weapon with her vitae just as the warrior does with her version of this power. However, on a successful strike, the blow does not inflict any damage at all. Instead, success on the damage roll causes the target to lose a point of temporary Willpower. More importantly, if the target loses all of his temporary Willpower by Baal&rsquo;s Caress, he temporarily becomes fully blood-bonded to the vizier. This effect only lasts for a single scene, but during that time, the target responds to the vizier as if he had drunk the vizier&rsquo;s blood three times. If the target is already bound to another vampire, she may roll Resolve (difficulty 7) to resist commands from the vizier that conflict with the wishes of her regnant as she understands them.<br><br>Ironically, Tremere, due to their Clan weakness, are particularly vulnerable to this power, and will remain under the effect of the temporary blood bond for the remainder of the night rather than a scene.<br><br><em><strong>Original - Warrior version:</strong></em><br>Baal&rsquo;s Caress does not increase the damage done by a given weapon, but that weapon inflicts aggravated damage rather than normal. No roll is necessary to activate this power, but one blood point is consumed per hit. For example, if a Cainite poisons his knife and strikes his opponent (even if he inflicts no damage), one blood point&rsquo;s worth of lubrication disappears. For this reason, many vampires choose to coat their weapons with a significant quantity of blood. If the vampire misses, no tainted blood is consumed.</p>",

An Obfuscated vampire doesn&rsquo;t actually become invisible, however &mdash; rather, he is able to delude observers into believing that he has vanished. Obfuscate also allows Kindred to change their features and conceal other people or objects. Typically vampires using Obfuscate must be within a short range of their witnesses (approximately five yards or meters per dot of Wits + Stealth) for their power to be effective.<br><br>Unless the Kindred chooses to make herself seen, she can remain obscured for as long as she wills it. At higher levels, the vampire can actually fade from sight so subtly that those nearby can&rsquo;t actually recall the moment at which she left.<br><br>Usually, few mortals or supernaturals (even those trained in Awareness) can pierce through the fog of Obfuscate. Animals, who rely more on their instincts than their normal senses, can sometime perceive (and be frightened by) the vampire&rsquo;s presence. Children and those to whom deception is foreign may also be able to pierce the illusion, at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion. Finally, the Auspex Discipline enables Kindred to see through Obfuscate. Even that is not guaranteed, however; refer to &ldquo;Seeing the Unseen,&rdquo; p. 142, for more details. (Storytellers needing a die roll for animals or children can use this quick and dirty guideline: treat them as if they had Auspex 1 in terms of contesting Obfuscate. They do not have the Auspex 1 power, but are considered to have it when determining whether a vampire is noticed.)<br><br>Since Obfuscate clouds the mind of the viewer, vampires can&rsquo;t use it to hide their presence from electronic or mechanical devices. Video and photo cameras, for example, capture the vampire&rsquo;s image accurately. Even so, the person using, say, her cell phone to record an Obfuscated vampire will still have her mind impacted by the power, and she won&rsquo;t see the Kindred&rsquo;s image until she views the video at a later date (if even then).<br><br>Several Clans cultivate this power &mdash; the Assamites, Followers of Set, and Malkavians, for example &mdash; but the Nosferatu are particularly known for this Discipline. Some elder Kindred believe that Caine, or perhaps Lilith, bestowed the Clan with this Discipline to compensate for the hideous physical deformities its members suffer.<br><br>Most Obfuscate powers last for a scene, or until the vampire ceases maintaining them. Once evoked, they require very little mental effort to keep in place.</p>",

A Kiss is resolved in the same way as a normal bite, but inflicts no health levels of damage. Upon connecting with a Kiss, the vampire may begin to drain the victim’s blood at the normal rate, and the victim is typically helpless to resist (see p. 269 for specifics).

The player spends one blood point for every 10 feet/3 meters of radius and rolls. The ritual takes the normal casting time if it is to be short-term (lasting for the rest of the night) or one night if it is to be long-term (lasting a year and a day).<br><br>Once the warding circle is established, any [ghosts] who attempts to cross its boundary feels a tingle on his skin and a slight breeze on his face &mdash; a successful Intelligence + Occult roll (difficulty 8) identifies this as a warding circle. If the [ghosts] attempts to press on, he must roll more successes on a Willpower roll (difficulty of the caster&rsquo;s Thaumaturgy rating + 3) than the caster rolled when establishing the ward. Failure indicates that the ward blocks his passage and inflicts three dice of bashing damage, and his next roll to attempt to enter the circle is at +1 difficulty. If the [ghosts] leaves the circle and attempts to enter it again, he must repeat the roll. Attempts to leave the circle are not blocked.</p>",

The player spends one blood point for every 10 feet/3 meters of radius and rolls.

Failure indicates that the ward blocks his passage and inflicts three dice of bashing damage, and his next roll to attempt to enter the circle is at +1 difficulty.

While many mortals are more or less devoted to a belief in some form of higher being or purpose, only a small number have the burning zeal, the profound conviction that can protect them against creatures like vampires. Note that, while most vampire legends portray the Damned being repelled by crosses and the like, Faith can manifest in any religious form. A devout Jew might be able to ward off vampires with her Star of David, or a Taoist might be able to intone special prayers, while a Christian lacking True Faith finds his crucifix impotent against the undead.<br><br>This Faith is not necessarily increased through experience. Certainly, it may rise as a result of a person&rsquo;s experience, but it is more vital than that, more a measure of conviction and strength of mind. Nor is it something that comes from outside the individual, from some God or angel. Whether or not their beliefs are correct, these people believe so unwaveringly that their own conviction protects them. At the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion, Faith should rise or fall to reflect a person&rsquo;s religious certainty and zeal.<br><br>The Faith Trait has a rating of 1 to 5. Exactly what protection is afforded to the individual by the Trait depends on this rating, as described below. These are just guidelines, however. Storytellers should amend them as required to fit the tone of their chronicles, or to add drama to their stories.</p>",
        "details": "<p>● Any character with Faith may attempt to ward off vampires by brandishing a holy symbol or uttering prayers. The person rolls Faith against a difficulty equal to the vampire&rsquo;s current Willpower points. The number of successes indicates the number of steps backward the vampire is forced to take. If no successes are scored, the vampire need not step back but may not advance. A botch indicates that the vampire may advance unhindered. Further, if the cross, Bible, or other holy symbol is placed against the vampire&rsquo;s body, each success causes an aggravated health level of damage, burning into the flesh.<br><br>●● A mortal with a Faith rating of 2 or more may resist Dominate and similar vampiric mind-control powers by spending Willpower (one point protects for a few turns).<br><br>●●● A person with a Faith of 3 or more may be able to sense the presence of a vampire, and can purchase the Awareness Skill. She need not consciously try to sense a vampire&rsquo;s presence, but must be in peaceful, quiet surroundings &mdash; perhaps alone in thought, praying, reading the Torah, meditating on the Bible, etc. The person will not sense the vampire&rsquo;s presence if she is preoccupied (e.g., arguing) or in a crowded, noisy place (jostled by a mob, in the midst of a raucous banquet, etc.). This ability is not infallible; the Storyteller should let the person sense the vampire only when it is dramatically convenient, or only after a successful Awareness roll. Note that the person cannot know exactly what she senses through her Faith; all that she will know is that something unclean or evil is nearby.<br><br>●●●● &nbsp;The mortal may not be turned into a ghoul, and is immune to any mind-altering Disciplines such as Dominate, Presence, and Obfuscate.<br><br>●●●●● The person is so pure, so holy, that she can fill a vampire with self-loathing, disgust, terror, and even physical pain. Any vampire hearing the person pray, preach, or recite psalms, or who is touched by the faithful, may be forced to flee immediately. A vampire who is unable to flee is reduced to a gibbering wreck, flailing on the floor and screaming, sobbing, or begging forgiveness. To avoid fleeing, the vampire must either expend one Willpower point per turn or make a Stamina roll each turn (difficulty of 5 + her own Intelligence) &mdash; the <em>higher </em>the vampire&rsquo;s Intelligence, the higher the difficulty, as the more tortured and guilty she feels.</p>",

Other Kindred scoff that this reasoning is an outright justification for the chaos that Dementation brings. They don&rsquo;t scoff too loudly, however, lest the Malkavian advance their consciousness next.</p>",

The subject must lie naked on bare earth for the entire duration of the ritual. Once the ritual is completed, its effects remain for a number of nights equal to the caster&rsquo;s Occult rating.<br><br>An individual affected by Chill of Oblivion treats aggravated damage from fire and high temperatures as if it were lethal damage. Furthermore, he may attempt to extinguish any fire by rolling Willpower (difficulty 9); each success reduces the fire&rsquo;s soak difficulty (see p. 297) by 1, and a fire with a soak difficulty of 2 dwindles to glowing embers.<br><br>However, this ritual has several drawbacks. First and foremost, the subject&rsquo;s aura is laced with writhing black veins that resemble those left by diablerie, and may well be mistaken for such by any observer who is not familiar with this ritual. The subject also radiates a palpable aura of cold that extends to about arm&rsquo;s length from him; this can be extremely disconcerting to mortals, though it causes no damage, and its game effects mirror those of the Flaws Touch of Frost (p. 494) and Eerie Presence (p. 495). Finally, the mystical nimbus of the ritual draws hostile ghosts to the subject, who may plague him with unwholesome acts.</p>",

The character cannot bring such relics to the physical world when she returns to her body, however.<br><br>Interaction with the physical world is impossible while using Psychic Projection. At best, the character may spend a Willpower point to manifest as a ghostlike shape. This apparition lasts one turn before fading away; while she can&rsquo;t affect anything physically during this time, the character can speak. Despite lacking physical substance, an astral character can use Auspex normally. At the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion, such a character may employ some or all Animalism, Dementation, Dominate, Necromancy, Obtenebration, Presence, Thaumaturgy, and similar non-corporeal powers she has, though this typically requires a minimum of three successes on the initial Psychic Projection roll.<br><br>If two astral shapes encounter one another, they interact as if they were solid. They may talk, touch, and even fight as if both were in the material world. Since they have no physical bodies, astral characters seeking to interact &ldquo;physically&rdquo; substitute Mental and Social Traits for Physical ones (Wits replaces Dexterity, Manipulation supplants Strength, and Intelligence replaces Stamina). Due to the lack of a material form, the only real way to damage another psychic entity is to cut its silver cord. When fighting this way, consider Willpower points to be health levels; when a combatant loses all of her Willpower, the cord is severed.<br><br>Although an astrally projected character remains in the reflection of the mortal world, she may venture further into the spirit realms, especially if she becomes lost. Other beings with particular sensitivity to psychic activity, such as ghosts, werewolves, and even some magi, travel the astral plane as well, and can interact with a vampire&rsquo;s psychic presence normally (although the astrally projected character is not considered a &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; for powers such as Necromancy). The observing character notices the astrally projecting vampire with a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 8), requiring more successes than the Psychic Projection activation roll. Even those who do notice you won&rsquo;t be able to identify you; you are merely an immaterial shade hovering in the general area. Storytellers are encouraged to make trips into the spirit world as bizarre, mysterious, and dreamlike as possible. The world beyond is a vivid and fantastic place, where the true nature of things is stronger and often strikingly different from their earthly appearances.</p>",

In nights of yore, when Assamites led the charges of Saracen legions, the Assassins were often seen licking their blades, slicing open their tongues and lubricating their weapons with this foul secretion.<br><br>Baal&rsquo;s Caress may be used to augment any bladed weapon; everything from poisoned knives and swords to tainted fingernails and claws has been reported.</p>",

With this power, the sorcerer can spend one point of blood that he smears across his eyes. For the rest of the scene, the sorcerer can perceive dematerialized spirits and similar creatures as if they were material. If he spends additional points of blood to coat a melee weapon such as a dagger or sword, that weapon can strike such targets and harm them normally despite their intangibility.<br><br><br><em><strong>Original - Warrior's Version:</strong></em><br>Baal&rsquo;s Caress does not increase the damage done by a given weapon, but that weapon inflicts aggravated damage rather than normal. No roll is necessary to activate this power, but one blood point is consumed per hit. For example, if a Cainite poisons his knife and strikes his opponent (even if he inflicts no damage), one blood point&rsquo;s worth of lubrication disappears. For this reason, many vampires choose to coat their weapons with a significant quantity of blood. If the vampire misses, no tainted blood is consumed.</p>",

When the stake penetrates a vampire&rsquo;s body, the tip breaks off and begins working its way through the victim&rsquo;s flesh to his heart. The trip may take several minutes or several nights, depending on where the stake struck. The stake eludes attempts to dig it out, burrowing farther into the victim&rsquo;s body to escape surgery. The only Kindred who are immune to this internal attack are those who have had their hearts removed by Serpentis.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The ritual takes five hours to enact, minus 30 minutes per success. The stake must be carved of rowan wood, coated with three blood points of the caster&rsquo;s blood, and blackened in an oak-wood fire. When the ritual is complete, the stake is enchanted to act as described above.<br><br>An attack with a Shaft of Belated Quiescence is performed as with a normal stake: a Dexterity + Melee roll (difficulty 6, modified as per the normal combat rules; the attack does not need to specifically target the heart) with a lethal damage rating of Strength + 1. If at least one health level of damage is inflicted after the target rolls to soak, the tip of the stake breaks off and begins burrowing. If not, the stake may be used to make subsequent attacks until it strikes deep enough to activate.<br><br>Once the tip of the stake is in the victim&rsquo;s body, the Storyteller begins an extended roll of the caster&rsquo;s Thaumaturgy rating (difficulty 9), rolling once per hour of game time. Successes on this roll are added to the successes scored in the initial attack. This represents the tip&rsquo;s progress toward the victim&rsquo;s heart. A botch indicates that the tip has struck a bone and all accumulated successes are lost (including those from the initial attack roll). Removing the part of the body where the tip impacted (such as a Tzimisce turning into blood or a vampire cutting off their arm) may stop the tip&rsquo;s progress, depending on the number of successes acquired and the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion. When the shaft accumulates a total of 15 successes, it reaches the victim&rsquo;s heart. This paralyzes Kindred and is instantly fatal to mortals and ghouls.<br><br>Attempts to surgically remove the tip of the shaft can be made with an extended Dexterity + Medicine roll made once per hour (difficulty 7 for Kindred and 8 for mortals). The surgeon must accumulate a number of successes equal to those currently held by the shaft in order to remove the tip. Once surgery begins, however, the shaft begins actively evading the surgeon&rsquo;s probes, and its rolls are made once every 30 minutes for the duration of the surgery attempt. Each individual surgery roll that scores less than three successes inflicts an additional unsoakable level of lethal damage on the patient.<br><br>Shaft of Belated Quiescence may be performed on other wooden impaling weapons, such as spears, arrows, practice swords, and pool cues, provided that they are made of rowan wood. It may not, however, create a Bullet of Belated Quiescence.</p>",

During the psychic struggle, the contestants&rsquo; eyes are locked on one another.<br><br>Once the Kindred overwhelms the subject&rsquo;s mind, the vampire moves his consciousness into the victim&rsquo;s body and controls it as easily as he uses his own. The mortal falls into a mental fugue while under possession. She is aware of events only in a distorted, dreamlike fashion. In turn, the vampire&rsquo;s mind focuses entirely on controlling his mortal subject. His own body lies in a torpid state, defenseless against any actions made toward it.<br><br>Vampires cannot possess one another in this fashion, as even the weakest Kindred&rsquo;s mind is strong enough to resist such straightforward mental dominance. Only through a blood bond can one vampire control another to this degree. Supernatural creatures also cannot be possessed in this way, although ghouls that have drunk from the vampire using Possession can.</p>",

Only if the attacker botches can the subject escape her fate, since this makes the target immune to any further Dominate attempts by that vampire for the rest of the story.<br><br>Once the target loses all her temporary Willpower, her mind is open. The vampire rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty 7) to determine how fully he assumes control of the mortal shell. Similar to the Animalism power Subsume the Spirit, multiple successes allow the character to utilize some mental Disciplines, noted on the chart below.

The vampire may also venture out during the day in the mortal form. However, the vampire&rsquo;s own body must be awake to do so, requiring a successful roll to remain awake (see p. 262). If the vampire leaves the mortal shell (by choice, if his body falls asleep, through supernatural expulsion, after sustaining significant injury, etc.), his consciousness returns to his physical form in an instant.<br><br>Once freed from possession, the mortal regains mental control of herself. This can happen in an instant, or the victim may lie comatose for days while her psyche copes with the violation.<br><br>The vampire experiences everything the mortal body feels during possession, from pleasure to pain. In fact, any damage the victim&rsquo;s body sustains is also applied to the character&rsquo;s body (though the Kindred may soak as normal). If the mortal dies before the vampire&rsquo;s soul can flee from the body, the character&rsquo;s body falls into torpor. Presumably this is in sympathetic response to the massive trauma of death, though some Kindred believe that the vampire&rsquo;s soul is cast adrift during this time and must find its way back to the body.<br><br>The Kindred can remain in the mortal&rsquo;s body even if his own torpid form is destroyed, though such a pathetic creature is not likely to exist for long. At each sunrise, the vampire must roll Courage (difficulty 8) or be expelled from the body. If forced from the mortal body, the vampire tumbles into the astral plane, his soul permanently lost in the spirit world. A vampire trapped in a mortal body may not be &ldquo;re-Embraced.&rdquo; If the Embrace occurs to such a creature, he simply meets Final Death.</p>",

While her senses of taste and touch extend no farther than normal, they likewise become far more distinct; the vampire could taste the hint of liquor in a victim&rsquo;s blood or feel the give of the board concealing a hollow space in the floor. The Kindred may magnify her senses at will, sustaining this heightened focus for as long as she desires. At the Storyteller&rsquo;s option, this may make hunting easier.<br><br>Occasionally, this talent provides extrasensory or even precognitive insights. These brief, unfocused glimpses may be odd premonitions, flashes of empathy, or eerie feelings of foreboding. The vampire has no control over these perceptions, but with practice can learn to interpret them with a fair degree of accuracy.<br><br>Expanded senses come at a price, however. Bright lights, loud noises and strong smells present a hazard while the vampire uses this power. In addition to the possibility for distraction, an especially sudden or potent stimulus (like the glare of a spotlight or a clap of thunder) can blind or deafen the Kindred for an hour or more.</p>",

In certain circumstances, dice rolls associated with using the character&rsquo;s sense (such as Perception + Alertness) decrease in difficulty by a number equal to the character&rsquo;s Auspex rating when the power is engaged.<br><br>The Storyteller may also use this power to see if the character perceives a threat. In this case, the Storyteller privately rolls the character&rsquo;s unmodified Auspex rating, applying whatever difficulty he feels best suits the circumstances. For example, sensing that a pistol is pointed at the back of the character&rsquo;s head may require a roll of difficulty 5, while the sudden realization that a rival for Primogen is planning her assassination may require a 9. Note that even this &ldquo;precognition&rdquo; comes only as a result of interpreting details the Kindred is able to notice. It&rsquo;s not an all-purpose insight or miraculous revelation.<br><br>At the character&rsquo;s discretion, she may selectively heighten one specific sense, rather than leaving them all on. In these cases, the difficulty to perceive stimuli using that sense drops by one, but the difficulty to avoid distraction or temporary bedazzlement increases by one.<br><br>This power does not let characters see in pitch darkness, as does Eyes of the Beast (p. 199), but it does reduce difficulty penalties to act in such darkness from +2 to +1, and the character may make ranged attacks in pitch darkness if she can hear, smell, or otherwise detect her foe.</p>",

He then drains the victim&rsquo;s blood into a large ceremonial golden bowl. There the blood is mixed with octli, amaranth flower, and other ingredients. When imbibed by the necromancer, this mixture causes him to sweat a glistening sheen of blood (equal to one blood point). The Kindred then dons the skin of his victim, which on a successful roll absorbs the Kindred vitae and begins to heal, forming a second skin over the vampire&rsquo;s own. The victim needs to be of similar stature &mdash; otherwise, the features become distorted and the disguise is rendered useless.

To preserve the skin&rsquo;s condition, the Kindred must bathe it in a blood point&rsquo;s worth of vitae nightly.

        "description": "<p>By changing the properties of her blood, a vampire may create powerful venom that strips her prey of his resilience. This power is greatly feared by other Kindred, and all manner of hideous tales concerning methods of delivery circulate among trembling coteries. Kindred with Quietus are known to deliver the poison by coating their weapons with it, blighting their opponents with a touch, or spitting it like a cobra. An apocryphal account speaks of a proud Prince who discovered an Assamite plotting her exsanguination and began to diablerize her would-be assassin. Halfway through the act, she learned that she had ingested a dire quantity of tainted blood and was then unable to resist the weakened hashashiyyin&rsquo;s renewed attack.</p>",
        "details": "<p>The sorcerer version of Scorpion&rsquo;s Touch is Scorpion&rsquo;s Curse. It allows the sorcerer to place a ward on a solid surface such as a door, a section of floor, or even a small object such as a box or a letter. The sorcerer may ward any object or area up to her Intelligence dots in square yards/meters. A few seconds after the power is activated, the blood ward fades and can only be spotted with a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 9) or a Perception + Investigation roll (difficulty 7). The ward lasts for a number of days equal to her Occult dots before dissipating, but while it lasts, anyone who touches the affected area or item is targeted by the Discipline just as though a warrior using Scorpion&rsquo;s Touch had successfully touched him.<br><br><br><em><strong>Original - Warrior Version:</strong></em><br>To convert a bit of her blood to poison, the Kindred&rsquo;s player spends at least one blood point and rolls Willpower (difficulty 6). If this roll is successful, and the vampire successfully hits (but not necessarily damages) her opponent, the target loses a number of Stamina points equal to the number of blood points converted into poison &mdash; vampires attempting to drink the blood of the Kindred with Scorpion&rsquo;s Touch are automatically considered to be &ldquo;successfully hit.&rdquo;<br><br>The victim may resist the poison with a Stamina + Fortitude roll (difficulty 6); successes achieved on the resistance roll subtract from the vampire&rsquo;s successes. The maximum number of blood points a Kindred may convert at any one time is equal to her Stamina. The number of successes scored indicates the duration of the Stamina loss.<br><br></p>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong> Successes</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 Successes</td>\n<td>One Turn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 Successes</td>\n<td>One Hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 Successes</td>\n<td>One Day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 Successes</td>\n<td>One Month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 Successes</td>\n<td>Permanently (though Stamina may be bought back up with experience)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br>If a mortal&rsquo;s Stamina falls to zero through use of Scorpion&rsquo;s Touch, she becomes terminally ill and loses any immunity to diseases, her body succumbing to sickness within the year unless she somehow manages to increase her Stamina again. If a Kindred&rsquo;s Stamina falls to zero, the vampire enters torpor and remains that way until one of her Stamina points returns. If a Kindred is permanently reduced to zero Stamina, she may recover from torpor only through mystical means.<br><br></p>\n<p>To afflict someone with the poison, the Cainite must touch her target&rsquo;s flesh or hit him with something that carries the venom. Many Assamites lubricate their weapons with the excretion, while others pool the toxin in their hands (or fleck their lips with the poison, for a &ldquo;kiss of death&rdquo;) and press it to their opponents. Weapons so envenomed must be of the melee variety &mdash; arrows, sling stones, bullets, thrown weapons, and the like cannot carry enough of the stuff to do damage, or it drips off in flight. Players whose vampires wish to spit at their targets must make a Stamina + Athletics roll (difficulty 6). No more than two blood points&rsquo; worth of poison may be expectorated, and a Kindred may spit a distance of 10 feet (3 meters) for each point of Strength (and Potence) the character possesses. Vampires with Quietus are immune to their own poison, but not the blood-venom of other Kindred with this power.</p>",

The player marks off the blood point, spends a point of Willpower, and rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty 8). If successful, the item temporarily becomes a fetter to one wraith. If the Kindred already knows the name of the wraith or has a strong psychic impression, then the object can become a fetter at any range, even to a ghost who normally does not come near the living world (so long as the ghost still exists). Otherwise, the necromancer must be able to see or sense the ghost (with Witness of Death, Shroudsight, or other such means).<br><br>A fetter artificially created in this fashion functions for all necromantic and ghostly purposes as a normal fetter: It can be detected with other Necromancy powers, the vampire gains a bonus to Necromancy against the wraith attuned to it, and the ghost similarly finds exertion of its powers easier upon the subject (so the vampire might turn an unwitting ghoul into a consort for a wraith familiar with possession...). The ghost can sink into the fetter to heal; conversely, if the fetter is destroyed, the wraith is banished to some inaccessible region of the Underworld, perhaps never to return.<br><br>A fetter created with Ephemeral Binding lasts for one night per success scored. The expenditure of an additional point of Willpower increases this duration to a week per success, whereas spending a permanent dot of Willpower extends the duration to a year and a day.<br><br>Botching with this power not only causes failure but also makes the ghost immediately aware of what the necromancer was trying to do.

Giovanni suffering from this Flaw are so tied to the Shadowlands that even in the lands of the living they must interact with the world of the dead on a nightly basis. To shadow walkers, objects in the Underworld are as real as anything found in the physical world. Such vampires find that the ghosts of walls may impeded their flight, ghostly objects may strike them, and wraiths&rsquo; powers work as if the Kindred were on the far side of the Shroud. This Flaw is similar to the Ash Path power Dead Hand (V20, p. 163), except that Shadow Walker is always on and it in no way allows the character possessing it to perceive beyond the Shroud.<br><br>The Storyteller may determine that certain Shadowlands topography interferes with you. Unless you have some ability to do so, you can&rsquo;t see into the Shadowlands, so you have to be careful in feeling your way about &mdash; essentially, a blind man subject to the Underworld landscape. At the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion, immaterial walls or environmental effects may restrict you.</p>",

More conservative Tremere, however, state that mixing Tremere magic with mortal science borders on treason or even blasphemy, and some European Regents have gone so far as to declare knowledge of Technomancy grounds for expulsion from their chantries.

        "description": "<p>With the Gift of Life, the character can experience the best and most positive things about being alive. The overwhelming hunger for blood temporarily abates, allowing the character to consume and enjoy food and drink. She can also enjoy sex as she wishes, and the sun does not burn her. The Gift of Life comes with a dark, terrible cost, however. Its use is almost sure to result in the death of a mortal, as the vampire must expend an enormous quantity of vitae in order to initiate it. The Discipline&rsquo;s effects last until the midnight after the character uses the power, so it is in her best interests to use it just after midnight.occ</p>",
        "details": "<p>The player spends 12 blood points, burning as much blood as possible each turn until she meets that level. She then rolls Stamina + Occult (difficulty 6) and needs only one success for the power to work. A botch has catastrophic effects. The character might be instantly killed or might inadvertently Embrace her victim, for example. If it takes longer than one turn to spend the necessary blood to enact this ability, it does not take effect until all 12 points have been spent. However, the blood must be spent continuously &mdash; the vampire cannot burn five, run off and feed, then burn seven more an hour later. On the other hand, she may feed as she activates the power &mdash; in one turn she might burn one blood point while drinking three. Since few Kindred above the Seventh Generation can easily expend such an amount of blood, the most efficient way to activate this power is to have a human nearby who can be sacrificed to power the transformation.<br><br>After her transformation, the character gains many traits of an ordinary human. She is largely immune to the scorching effects of the sun (Fortitude difficulties to soak damage from direct sunlight are halved, and she takes no damage if she is sufficiently covered), and she can experience and enjoy many of the fine things about human life. She retains a few of her vampiric benefits, however. Fortitude and Auspex abilities remain in place if she has either of those Disciplines, and the Storyteller may allow her to retain other Disciplines as well if he deems them dramatically appropriate. She also retains a vampire&rsquo;s benefits when it comes to handling bashing damage. However, she is still vulnerable to holy artifacts, human faith, and being staked. Her blood remains vitae, not human blood. Use of this ability &mdash; which creates a mockery of human life &mdash; may interfere with a character&rsquo;s Path advancement, at the Storyteller&rsquo;s discretion.<br><br>The vampire is no more vulnerable to fire than any other mortal while in this half-alive state, but she still suffers somewhat from the Beast. Frenzy and R&ouml;tschreck difficulties are halved (round up). She can remain active during the day without Humanity or Path-based dice pool caps, although she is certainly tired during the day, since that is not her usual time of activity.<br><br>Her Beast exacts a dangerous retribution when her day of &ldquo;life&rdquo; is done. Although its influence is greatly suppressed during this power&rsquo;s duration, the Beast has its way with the vampire for the next six nights, as all difficulties to resist frenzy increase by three. The wise necromancer hides herself away somewhere during that period, but, depending on morality and temperament, enforced isolation might drive her to frenzy on its own.</p>",

Strafing adds 10 dice to accuracy on a standard attack roll, and empties the clip. A maximum of three yards/meters can be covered with this maneuver.\n\nThe attacker divides any successes gained on the attack roll evenly among all targets in the covered area (successes assigned to hit an individual are added to that target’s damage dice pool, as well). If only one target is within range or the area of effect, only half the successes affect him. The attacker then assigns any leftover successes as she desires. If fewer successes are rolled than there are targets, only one may be assigned per target until they are all allocated.\n\nDodge rolls against strafing are at +1 difficulty",
